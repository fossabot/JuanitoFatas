I live in Tokyo. It's cold winter compares to where I came from.

My favorite food right now are [Sukiyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiyaki), [Abura Soba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen#Related_dishes), and [Carbonara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AAdKl1UYZs).

I am focusing on:

- Understanding deeply about Ruby and database
- [Cooking pasta](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChefStefanoBarbato)
- Learning Japanese language
- Reading on management and career
- Writing some Ruby programs for fun
- Reading [The Dark Forest (Remembrance of Earth's Past #2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest)
- Reading [Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36417234-powerful)

And looking for new challenges. Thanks for reading! :bow:
